Excellent question. Creating a new file is a smart way to ensure clean formatting. Here is a structured guide on what to modify, add, remove, and keep for each section of your paper as you copy the content over.

This plan incorporates all reviewer feedback and reframes your work as a **conceptual framework**, which is the most effective and honest way to address the comments.

---

### **Overall Action**

- **Action:** Perform a thorough proofread of the entire new document to fix all typos and grammatical mistakes, as mentioned by Reviewer #2. For example, the text "Enrage, creacte & fleflect" in a diagram should be corrected.
    

---

### **Title, Authors, and Affiliations**

- **Keep:** The title is strong and descriptive. Keep the author and affiliation details as they are.
    
- **Remove / Add / Modify:** Nothing needed.
    

---

### **Abstract**

- **Remove:** Delete the entire old abstract.
    
- **Add:** Paste in the new, revised abstract provided in the previous response. It is specifically structured to satisfy the reviewers.
    

---

### **Index Terms (Keywords)**

- **Keep:** The current keywords are relevant and accurate.
    
- **Remove / Add / Modify:** Nothing needed.

### **I. Introduction**

- **Keep:**
    
    - The explanation of the problems with traditional credentialing (inefficiency, fraud).
        
    - The general introduction to blockchain as a decentralized, tamper-proof solution.
        
- **Modify:**
    
    - At the end of the introduction, modify the text to clearly define the paper's contribution. Frame it as a response to the limitations of existing blockchain solutions.
        
- **Add:**
    
    - Add a clear thesis statement at the end of this section. **Example:** "This paper therefore proposes a novel architectural framework that leverages Oasis Sapphire's confidential compute capabilities to overcome these limitations, offering a model for secure, private, and scalable academic credentialing."
        
- **Remove:**
    
    - Any language that suggests a system has already been built or fully implemented.
        

---

### **II. Literature Survey**

- **Keep:**
    
    - Your discussion of existing systems like MIT Blockcerts, Hyperledger models, and government initiatives.
        
- **Modify:**
    
    - Strengthen your analysis of each existing system. Instead of just describing them, modify the text to explicitly point out their specific weaknesses (e.g., the privacy issues of public chains, the centralization of private chains). This directly addresses Reviewer #1's comment about a "meaningful literature review."
        
- **Add:**
    
    - A concluding paragraph that summarizes the gaps you identified in existing research. This will create a logical bridge to your proposed solution.
        
- **Remove:**
    
    - Table I ("AREAS OF CONCERN AND THEIR EXISTING LITERATURE") is weak and breaks the flow. Remove it and integrate its points into your written paragraphs for a more professional and readable section.
        

---

### **III. Methods**

- **Modify:**
    
    - Change the section title from "METHODS" to "**PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE**" or "**CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK**".
        
    - Rephrase all descriptions from past tense (e.g., "the system performed") to a conditional or descriptive tense (e.g., "the architecture is designed to perform" or "the system would perform"). This is the most critical change in the entire paper.
        
    - Make sure to cite your equations properly in the text as requested by Reviewer #3.
        
        **Example:** "...as shown in Equation (1), the credential data is encrypted."
        
- **Add:**
    
    - Add subheadings for better organization, as suggested by Reviewer #3. For instance: `3.1 System Components`, `3.2 Credential Issuance Flow`, and `3.3 Verification Process`.
        

---

### **IV. Result and Analysis**

- **Modify:**
    
    - Change the section title to "**THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON**".
        
    - Modify all descriptions of performance to reflect that they are **projections** based on documented data, not results from a prototype.
        
        **Example:** Change "Verification time is reduced by up to 75%" to "Based on Oasis Sapphire's documented performance, verification time is projected to be reduced by up to 75%."
        
    - Modify the captions for all tables (II, III, IV) and Figure 4 to state they represent a theoretical or comparative analysis.
        
- **Add:**
    
    - Add a new, clean quantitative comparison table that pits your _projected_ model against others (Ethereum, Hyperledger) on key metrics like cost, speed, and privacy. This directly addresses the requests from Reviewer #1 and #2.
        
- **Remove:**
    
    - **Crucially, remove this sentence:** "In order to make a first step towards validating its efficiency, a prototype implementation using sample credentials from several academic institutions was realized." This statement is inaccurate and must be removed.
        

---

### **V. Conclusion**

- **Modify:**
    
    - Rewrite the conclusion to summarize the contributions of your **proposed framework**. Reiterate the _projected_ benefits (privacy, scalability, cost-efficiency).
        
- **Add:**
    
    - A short paragraph on "Future Work." **Example:** "The next logical step for this research is to develop a functional prototype of the proposed architecture to empirically validate these projected performance metrics and assess its real-world usability." This is standard practice for conceptual papers.

### **References**

- **Modify:**
    
    - Carefully check the formatting of every single reference to ensure it perfectly matches the IEEE standard, as noted by Reviewer #2.
