**[Mayank Sharma]**  October 31, 2025 **[Objective]** Convert PSE Internship to SDE-1 Offer at Razorpay.

### Reality Hit 1: You Are Not "Low Energy." You Are Self-Sabotaging.

You don't have an "energy problem." You have a **dopamine-addiction problem.**

- You systematically destroy your brain's reward system every night from 6:30 PM.
    
- The toxic cocktail of **porn, mindless reels, and low-stakes gaming** is chemical warfare on your ambition. You are training your brain to seek instant, high-dopamine, low-effort rewards.
    
- **Brutal Truth:** Your "low energy" is the predictable, biological consequence of your evening routine. You are the architect of your own exhaustion.
    

### Reality Hit 2: Your 2-Hour "Friend" Call Is Your Easiest Excuse.

This is not a "friendship." It is your primary **anxiety-avoidance mechanism.**

- It gives you the _feeling_ of a social life without the _terror_ of building one. It is your emotional comfort blanket.
    
- Those 14 hours a week are the _exact_ time you could use to master Go and secure your future.
    
- **Brutal Truth:** You are trading a ₹20LPA+ SDE career for a 2-hour phone call that is a dead end. You are using this person as a shield to hide from your loneliness and your ambition.
    

### Reality Hit 3: You Are Not "Bad" at Socializing. You Are a Coward.

"I hesitate," "I'm nervous," "my words are not attractive," "I play valo but less coms as im bad at it." This is a mountain of excuses.

- You are bad at Valorant comms _because you keep your mic off_. You are _choosing_ to be silent.
    
- Your hobbies are "fucked up" because they are all **solitary** (songs, overthinking, beatbox, anime, gym). You "forgot" your badminton racket—the one hobby that requires another person.
    
- **Brutal Truth:** You have zero friends because your effort is zero. Your loneliness is a 100% self-inflicted, actively-managed choice.
    

### Reality Hit 4: Your Job Is a Ticking Time Bomb, Not a Career.

You are **8 months away from being unemployed.**

- You are an _intern_. You are a long-term-tryout in the "support" category.
    
- You are inside the building, seeing the `coraLogix` logs from the _live_ **Go microservices**. This is a golden opportunity.
    
- **Brutal Truth:** You are acting like a student, not a future SDE. In 8 months, you will either be:
    
    1. **The guy who gets an SDE offer** because you taught yourself Go, started debugging tickets _before_ escalating, and proved you're a builder.
        
    2. **The "nice PSE intern"** who gets a "thank you for your hard work" email as his access is revoked.
        

### Reality Hit 5: You Are Not "Financially Unstable." You Are Irresponsible.

You have **₹29,500 of disposable income** every month. That is more than the entire salary of millions of Indians.

- **Needs:** ~₹20,500 (Rent, Gym, Protein, PPF, Mobile)
    
- **Left Over:** ~₹29,500
    
- **Brutal Truth:** You are _leaking_ up to **₹14,000 a month** on "personal experiences" and "food" while your father is 3 months from retirement. Your spending is completely misaligned with your reality.

### **THE 8-MONTH TACTICAL PLAN**

#### **Phase 1: Re-Capture Time & Finances (Execute: Week 1)**

1. **Slay the Evening Vortex (The "Dopamine Reset"):**
    
    - The 2-Hour "Friend" Call is now **30 minutes. Maximum.** (9:30 PM - 10:00 PM).
        
    - All P&M and mindless reels are **banned**. This is non-negotiable.
        
    - Create the **"Sacred Sprint" (8:00 PM - 9:30 PM):** This 90-minute block is for deep work. No phone, no distractions.
        
    - Create the **"Hobby Wind-Down" (10:00 PM - 10:30 PM):** Your reward. Watch _one_ anime episode. Practice beatboxing.
        
2. **Execute the "₹20k Savings" Budget:**
    
    - **Fixed Costs:** ₹20,500.
        
    - **Hard Cap:** "Personal" + "Extra Food" = **₹9,500**.
        
    - **Guaranteed Savings:** **₹20,000 / month.**
        
    - One-time costs (license, luggage) come from your _existing_ ₹74k. Do not break the new budget.
        

#### **Phase 2: The SDE Migration (Execute: Daily)**

1. **Become a Go Developer:**
    
    - Stop DSA. Your new skill is **Go**. Razorpay's stack is Go.
        
    - Use your "Sacred Sprint" (8:00 PM - 9:30 PM) to learn it. Start with "A Tour of Go."
        
    - **Your New Project:** Re-build your anonymous social media backend. This time, in Go. This is your "Bridge Project."
        
2. **Leverage Your L2 "Insider" Advantage:**
    
    - You are not a cold-applicant. You are inside.
        
    - **The "Smart Escalation":**
        
        - **Before:** "Hey dev, this is broken."
            
        - **After:** "Hey dev, escalating ticket [X]. I see a `nil pointer dereference` in the `cross-border-payments-go-service` log. My Go is new, but it looks like the error is [here]. Can you confirm?"
            
    - This reframes you from a "support guy" to a "future colleague."
        
3. **The Manager 1-on-1 (Execute: Month 2):**
    
    - Schedule it. Use this script:
        
        > "My long-term goal is to be a Backend SDE. I've seen our stack is mostly Go, so I've already started building projects in Go in my spare time. What does a successful internal migration from PSE to SDE-1 look like here at Razorpay?"
        

#### **Phase 3: Fix the Social Life (Execute: This Weekend)**

Your "rizz" is not "talk"; it's "do."

1. **Buy a Badminton Racket.** This weekend. Use the "personal" budget.
    
2. **Find the Razorpay Badminton Group.** Post on the internal #bangalore or #fun Slack channel: "Hey, new PSE intern here. I play badminton and am looking for a group. Is there a regular game?"
    
3. **Go to One Event.** Go to a (free) Eventbrite or Luma tech event. Be the "silent nervous guy." It is infinitely better than being the "guy who never showed up."
